The Employee Management System (EMS) is a role-based web application designed to manage employee records efficiently and securely. 
Developed with ReactJS for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL as the database, EMS ensures a seamless user experience with robust data management.

The system caters to two types of users: Admin and Employee.
Admins act as super users with full privileges to create, update, and delete employee records, while Employees can only view their personal details.
EMS features comprehensive sections for managing an employee’s Personal, Professional, Project, and Finance information, each with built-in validations 
for fields such as Employment Code, Email, Phone Numbers, and Addresses.

Key Features:
Admin Dashboard: Admins can view, edit, or delete employee records, manage project assignments, and track finance details.
Employee Dashboard: 
Employees can view their personal data and download payslips but cannot edit sensitive fields like Employment Code, Gender, or Date of Birth.
Role-based Navigation: 
The system ensures secure access to functionalities based on the user’s role, providing a tailored experience for Admins and Employees.
Project and Finance Management: 
Track project history and manage finance details, with the ability to download payslips securely.
This system guarantees data integrity and security by restricting updates to sensitive employee details while offering an intuitive, role-specific management interface.
